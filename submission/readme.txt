Taylor Gunter 

Project 1 

Collaboration:

The structure of the code follows the scatterTutorial.js code from lecture. 

I chatted with Keaton Whitehead and Matt Coker about part 5 and part 2 respectively. I looked at their code to try to debug my code. 

I used a few stackoverflow boards to answer questions as well as bl.ocks.org 

My code is commented with the url of any site where I got code or soluitons to issues I was having. 

The sources are also gathered in this doc:

All parts should work as directed in the project rubric
